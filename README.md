# Mailman

The idea of Mailman is simple: A web based social media that literally shows you a "web" of where your posts have reached on the globe. If someone "likes" a post, it gets shared on their "network". The web expands to their real time locations the first time they see it. 

It would share everything within a 10 mile radius of the post/"like" location for everyone to see.
